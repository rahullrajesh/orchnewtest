                <p>
                  It was difficult to focus; had his graduation final exams in a week’s time; kept getting distracted.    
                </p>
                <p>
                  I asked whether he wanted to present one of his PPT presentations, that he had created some time back, to his friends on our Orchvate social platform. He was excited - decided to present Maruti Ciaz new Facelift Model. Refreshed his research on Sigma, Delta, Zeta, Alpha, Ciaz S; wanted to ensure he was able to answer questions on any variant. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I remember asking him once “Do you write all this data anywhere” …he seriously had said “Yes, I do” and on probing clarified - " I do it in my head - in separate files. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Presentation went well – never read any slide. Kept walking around while presenting and the neurotypical NT me insisted that he sits in one place – possibly because it was bothering me!! Said much more than was on the slides; when the NT me got impatient and jumped to the next slide he politely yet firmly asked me to go back. This happened 2 to 3 times, he told me I needed to stay on the slide till he said Next. In all these years he had got used to dealing with the NT me.
                </p>
               <img src="assets/img/blog_img/Neurotypical.png" class="image-blog" alt="">
               <p>
                <br>On the evening before the exams I wished him all the best, and asked him how he felt – he said he was nervous – I was expecting the response and I explained that it was a natural feeling. He said he was sad - I was not expecting this response. It was going to be the last exam of his life. NT me laughed asked him not to joke. He said he was serious.
              </p>
              <p>
                The day after the exams I told him to do some research on how the car engine works. He instantly got to work and later sent me a complex, impressive diagram of the engine. I asked whether he had got it from internet – Google. He clarified, internet, YouTube. He had watched a video on how the engine works and the picture was all over his brain. He thought it would be good to put it on paper lest it fades away after a few years. It was so big and all over the place that he was not able to fit it on one page and so he used 2A4s!! 
              </p>
              <p>
                I just gifted him an online course on Automotive Design. In half a day, he has finished it and is now politely insisting that I should gift him the next level. 
              </p>

                <p>
                  Where will you get an NT who can store so much in the brain and focus so crazily on something. You give "them" an area of their interest - the focus is unbeatable, and the memory is unfailing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  No NT would want to start studying the next day after exams got over. NTs would want a break. You give them the work "they" want to do – and they need no breaks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  For a generic PPT an NT would never research on the variants. "They" always ensure perfection; they don't understand shortcuts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  NTs wouldn't think of engaging in something that was not related to studies a week before the final exams, because NTs want good grades. "They" are motivated for reasons they know best. It is not to do well in the exams that’s for sure.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Who needs the label, NTs or "they"??</b>
